# makemehappy
Here's some sample Python code that could make you happy:

--
This code creates a list called feelings that contains a few different positive emotions. The make_me_feel_good() function uses the random.choice() function to randomly select one of the emotions from the list and print it to the screen.

When you run the code, it will print out a random positive feeling each time, for example: "I'm feeling joyful"

Please note that this code is just for fun and it's not meant to replace real-world therapy. If you're feeling down, you should talk to a professional.
